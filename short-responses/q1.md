# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer

Making API requests with API keys from the frontend of an application makes that API key in danger of being compromised. If instead the API request is sent from the server, the API key will be hidden since the server will only send information to clients that it is programmed to.
